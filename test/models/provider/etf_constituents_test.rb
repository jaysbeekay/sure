# `parsed.dig("ETF_Data", "Holdings")` would sail straight past them. These assert
# the mapping against a payload shaped like EODHD's own response, so the key names
# themselves are under test -- the same reason 3.1 has its own provider field test.
#
# The endpoint is the one `fetch_security_info` already calls for every security,
# so constituents cost no additional provider request.
