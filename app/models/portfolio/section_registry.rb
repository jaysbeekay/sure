# The list of sections the portfolio hub renders, in the order the user last
# left them.
#
# Same shape as ReportsController#build_reports_sections -- a hash per section
# with `key`, an i18n `title` key, a `partial`, its `locals`, and the `visible`
# / `collapsible` flags -- so the Reports section chrome (drag to reorder,
# chevron to collapse) renders it unchanged. It lives here rather than in the
# controller because the ordering rule and the section list are domain
# decisions the controller only renders, and because a PORO can be unit-tested
# without a request.
#
# Every local a partial needs is passed in. Nothing here (and nothing in the
# partials) reads Date.current or Current.family: the controller captures one
# `as_of` and one statement per request and hands them down, so the sections
# that take a date all read the same one.

  # defaults for anything else.
