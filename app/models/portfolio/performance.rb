# Implements contract rows R3, R4, R5, R8, R14, R15 (applied to the whole scope)

# CACHING (R14). The key comes from Family#build_cache_key with
# `invalidate_on_data_updates: true`, which folds in `latest_sync_completed_at`.
# `entries_cache_version` -- the key the rest of InvestmentStatement uses -- is
# NOT sufficient here: it is `entries.count` plus `entries.maximum(:updated_at)`,
# and a daily price sync changes holdings and therefore balances while touching
# no entry at all. Returns cached on it would stay stale until the user next
# edited a transaction.
#
# The family currency is in the key too. Every figure is converted into it
# (R2), and Family#build_cache_key does not include it, so a family that
# changes currency would otherwise be served figures in the previous one.

  # than a return (R17), and an account with a single balance day withholds the

  # `active_until_dates` and `scope_account_ids` are easy to forget because

  # a cut-off date drops an account's later history entirely -- so omitting them
  # would let the first caller to use them read another caller's cached answer.
  #
  # Both the flow scope and the cut-off dates are keyed as DailyReturns resolves
  # them, not as they were passed. For the scope: an omitted one means "the
  # accounts themselves" while an explicit `[]` means "nothing is inside", and
  # those classify transfers differently. For the cut-offs: DailyReturns
  # compacts them and normalises each value to an ISO8601 string, so
  # `{ id => nil }` is valid input meaning "no cut-off" and has to key
  # identically to an omitted hash -- which it does only after that compaction,
  # and a key-type difference would key two identical scopes differently.
  #
  # Nothing is converted here for the same reason: the resolved values are
  # already the strings DailyReturns keyed its own query on, so a `to_date`
  # round trip would only re-parse them.

  # The digest only shortens the key; nothing depends on it being secret.
