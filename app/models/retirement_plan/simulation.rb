# The retirement planner's year-by-year projection.
#
# Pure, like RetirementPlan::Projection: every input is handed in, the
# reference date among them, and nothing here reads the clock, the database or
# the current request.
#
# One row per calendar year, from the reference date's year to the year the
# plan's owner reaches the end age. Within a year the withdrawal comes out
# first and the contribution goes in last:
#
#   V(n + 1) = (V(n) - W(n)) * (1 + r) + C(n)
#
# Before retirement W holds only one-off amounts, which is the recurrence
# RetirementPlan::Projection uses whenever there are none. From the
# retirement year, W is spending less income, never below zero, and income
# beyond spending is reinvested as C.
#
# `expected_annual_return` is the compound annual return before inflation.
# Streams marked `indexed` grow with `inflation_rate` from the reference year,
# as does the contribution. `end_value_real` is the end value in the
# reference year's money.
class RetirementPlan::Simulation
  # A calendar-year span of spending or income. `start_year` nil runs from the
  # reference year; `end_year` nil runs to the end age. A one-off is paid once,
  # in its start year.
