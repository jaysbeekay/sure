    def description
      <<~INSTRUCTIONS
        Use this to propose asset class, sub-class, sector and region for securities
        the user holds that are not classified yet.

        This records a PROPOSAL for the user to review and approve. It does not
        classify anything. Nothing you send here changes a figure the user sees
        until they approve it on the classification review screen.

        Propose only what you can justify from the instrument itself -- its name,
        ticker, exchange and type. Say why in `rationale`; the user reads it when
        deciding. Leave a field out rather than guessing it: a proposal that only
        names the region is more useful than one that invents an asset class.

        Securities the user has already classified by hand, or locked, are skipped
        and reported back in `skipped`.

        Example:

        ```
        suggest_security_classification({
          proposals: [
            {
              ticker: "VWRA",
              asset_class: "equity",
              region: "north_america",
              rationale: "Accumulating global equity ETF, majority US-weighted."
            }
          ]
        })
        ```
      INSTRUCTIONS
