# What the assistant thinks a security is, held separately from what it IS.
#
# The separation is the point. `classification_source` exists so a figure in an
# allocation chart can be traced to whoever asserted it, and a model that wrote
# straight to `securities` would be indistinguishable from a provider. So the
# assistant writes here, a person approves, and only approval touches the
# security.
#
# Family-scoped, because the proposal belongs to the household whose assistant
# made it. Its EFFECT is not: approving writes the globally shared `securities`
# row, exactly as 3.3's manual override does.
