  # legitimately returns and break ingestion for that provider.
  #

  # defaults every one of them would raise at construction the day these

  # Whether this provider can answer for a security's sector/industry.
  # DECLARED, not inferred from a response, because the caller has to decide
  # whether to ASK before it has one.
  #
  # `Security::Provided#import_provider_details` gates the fetch on evidence
  # that it has already asked -- a filled `sector`/`industry`, or a
  # `classification_fetched_at` stamp. Without a capability to consult, that
  # gate conflates "asked, nothing there" with "asked a provider that has
  # nothing to give", and the two need opposite handling: the first should
  # never be asked again, the second should be asked as soon as a capable
  # provider is configured.
  #
  # THE DEFAULT IS FALSE, and that is a trade rather than an obvious choice.
  # Seven of the ten security providers supply no classification, so false is
  # right for most of them and stops a per-sync fetch that answers nothing.
  # The cost: a provider added later that DOES supply one, and forgets to say
  # so, is silently never asked, and it reads as missing data rather than a
  # missing line here. A new provider that returns `sector:` from
  # `fetch_security_info` must override this.
  #
  # Same shape as `max_history_days` below: declared on the concept, safely
  # defaulted, overridden by the providers it applies to.
  def supplies_classification?
    false

  # Maximum number of calendar days of historical data the provider can return.
  # Callers should clamp start_date to avoid requesting data beyond this window.
  # Override in subclasses with provider-specific limits.
